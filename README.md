## Overview
This repository accompanies our published work on **μ-Net**, a novel deep learning architecture for **accurate colorectal polyp segmentation** in colonoscopy images.

The proposed model integrates **multi-scale feature extraction** with **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to improve segmentation accuracy, transparency, and clinical reliability.
