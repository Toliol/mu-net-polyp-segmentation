## Overview

This repository accompanies the published paper:

> **An Integrated Architecture for Colorectal Polyp Segmentation: The μ-Net Framework with Explainable AI**  
> *Diagnostics, 2025*

We propose **μ-Net**, a novel encoder–decoder segmentation architecture designed for **accurate and robust colorectal polyp segmentation** in colonoscopy images.  
The model integrates **multi-scale feature extraction**, **residual learning**, and **attention mechanisms (CBAM)**, while also providing **Explainable AI (XAI)** visualizations to support clinical trust.

## Key Contributions

- Proposed **μ-Net**, an enhanced U-Net–based architecture with **multi-branch μ-blocks** for rich feature representation.
- Integrated **CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)** within encoder and decoder blocks to recalibrate **spatial and channel-wise features**.
- Introduced specialized building blocks:
  - **CBRes Block**
  - **Dual Dilate-CB Block**
  - **TriDilation Attention Unit (TDAU)**
  - **SplitFusion Block**
- Achieved **94.02% Dice coefficient** on the **Kvasir-SEG** dataset, outperforming several state-of-the-art models.
- Maintained **computational efficiency** (≈39.04 GFLOPs, 15 ms inference time).
- Integrated **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods, including **Saliency Maps** and **Grad-CAM**, to visualize model attention and improve interpretability.

## Model Architecture

μ-Net follows an **encoder–decoder structure** with skip connections and residual learning.

Key architectural highlights:

- **μ-block** with six parallel feature branches for multi-scale contextual learning
- **CBAM modules** embedded throughout the network for adaptive attention
- **Residual connections** to stabilize deep training
- **Nearest-neighbor upsampling** to preserve fine boundary details
- Final **Sigmoid output layer** for binary polyp segmentation

📌 *See Figures 4–10 in the paper for detailed architectural diagrams.*

## Explainable AI (XAI)

To enhance clinical reliability, μ-Net incorporates post-hoc explainability:

- **Grad-CAM**
- **Saliency Maps**

These methods highlight image regions contributing most to segmentation decisions, aligning model attention with clinically relevant polyp regions.
